# Easy-Flatpak
A simple script to help install flatpak apps faster

One of the issues I face when installing a new distro is having to install all the flatpak apps one by one and being kind of a linux noob, I dont know if there is even another way, so I've developed a simple script with which you can easily install multiple flatpak apps at once. Feel free to make any improvements you feel is necessary and I've just started learning bash so any feedback is welcome!

This is my first every script, created using Bash so expect things to look quite janky :)

Note: Parts of this script was fetched using ChatGPT

# Usage

To run the script, clone into this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/cbcb00/Easy-Flatpak.git
```
Then move to the directory
```
cd Easy-Flatpak
```
Run the script
```
./easy_flatpak.sh
```
To close simply press 'Ctrl+c'

# Possible Issues
If you are unable to run the script, you would need to make it executable, you can do that by copying below.
```
chmod +x easy_flatpak.sh
```
