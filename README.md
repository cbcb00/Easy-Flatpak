# Easy-Flatpak
A simple script to help install flatpak apps faster

One of the issues I face when installing a new distro is having to install all the flatpak apps one by one and being kind of a linux noob, I dont know if there is even another way, so I've developed a simple script with which you can easily install multiple flatpak apps at once. Feel free to make any improvements you feel is necessary and I've just started learning bash so any feedback is welcome!

To use it, simply clone this repo and run the flatapp_helper.sh script

This is my first every script, created using Bash so expect things to look quite janky :)

Note: Parts of this script was fetched using ChatGPT
